Fundamental research in&nbsp;the field of&nbsp;behavioral economics has shown that decisions made by&nbsp;market participants are often irrational and subject to&nbsp;the influence of&nbsp;psychological, cognitive, emotional and social factors. Thus, several Nobel prizes in&nbsp;Economics were awarded for research in&nbsp;the field of&nbsp;behavioral economic (Daniel Kahneman (2002), Robert Schiller (2013), Richard Thaler (2017)). One of&nbsp;the reasons of&nbsp;irrational behavior of&nbsp;investors is&nbsp;excessive or&nbsp;insufficient reaction to&nbsp;news information. This problem is&nbsp;particularly acute in&nbsp;the market of&nbsp;crypto assets; its high volatility is&nbsp;largely determined by&nbsp;the information background. 

Thanks to&nbsp;the development of&nbsp;information technology and artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence), it&nbsp;became possible to&nbsp;analyze information from a&nbsp;variety of&nbsp;information sources automatically. A&nbsp;number of&nbsp;modern studies has shown the correlation of&nbsp;price dynamics in&nbsp;stock markets with the content of&nbsp;news and social media resources (R.&nbsp;Peterson &laquo;Trading on&nbsp;Sentiment: The Power of&nbsp;Minds over Markets&raquo;, P.&nbsp;Tetlock &laquo;The Role of&nbsp;Media in&nbsp;Finance&raquo;, S.&nbsp;Yang and S.&nbsp;Mo&nbsp;&laquo;Social Media and News Sentiment Analysis for Advanced Investment Strategies&raquo;). 

The GIST platform is&nbsp;a&nbsp;tool for online analyzing the current information flow in&nbsp;the field of&nbsp;crypto assets and making investment decisions based on&nbsp;it. 

The GIST platform uses the latest technology to&nbsp;work with big data (Big Data) and machine learning (Machine Learning) to&nbsp;solve the following tasks: 
* automatic collection of&nbsp;news information from an&nbsp;unlimited number of&nbsp;sources; 
* automatic content analysis of&nbsp;news text; 
* automatic filtering of&nbsp;information on&nbsp;its relevance to&nbsp;the crypto asset market; 
* automatic clustering of&nbsp;information on&nbsp;topics and coverage opportunity; 
* automatic sentiment analysis of&nbsp;news text; 
* automatic ranking of&nbsp;news and news sources in&nbsp;order of&nbsp;influence on&nbsp;the crypto asset market; 
* automatic evaluation of&nbsp;the current information background for investment decision making.
